Bibliometric method utilize analysis and knowledge mapping to quantify literature evaluation, including citations, authorships, keywords, and methodology. (TITLE-ABS-KEY ("nixtamaliz*") AND TITLE-ABS-KEY ("corn" OR "maize") in the period between 2010 and 2023 obtained in [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri?display=basic#basic) and [Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/basic-search). The total number of documents obtained from Scopus and WOS are 364 and 370, respectively. The csv files from two databases are combined into one worksheet using Append Query in Microsoft Excel 2021 program and filtered using Conditional Formatting. The total number of documents for Scopus, WOS, and Scopus-WOS are 123, 129, and 241, respectively. After the removal of duplicates, records of documents were reduced to 441. However, VOSviewer (version 1.6.19) for Bibliometric Analysis cannot determine the necessary data when combining two databases. Therefore, it is recommended to use R Studio or other related software. The submitted paper only covers the Scopus.
