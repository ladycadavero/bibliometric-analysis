Hi,

I'm Lady Shernalyn Cadavero, an MS in Chemistry student, and welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am upskilling my career in Data Analytics because of several skills I already have in Chemistry. Being in the Chemistry field had some similarities to Data Analytics, where the analyst identified trends, analysis of data after experimentation, data cleaning, applying statistics to support conclusions, and storytelling for the project flow following recommendations in optimizing processes. Data analytics has extensive industries like healthcare, finance, and technology. 

Currently, I am self studying for Data Analytics tools.
